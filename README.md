# MySites 
A self hosted website that wraps commonly used webtools, for easily switching between with a single click of a sidebar 

## Purpose 
The purpose is more for the aesthetics then anything else since most browser have "bookmarks" or "pins". 
I aim to have this open at all times on a touchscreen/tablet on my wall to have instant accsess to my calander, inventory management system and other commonly used web applicatoins.

## Design requirements / Features
* nice looking overlay to quickly switch between web applications
* ability to move and customize the location of the overlay incase it blocks important information on the site
* customizing the name and icon of each site, while offering a defult.
* remembering the state of each application, dont close and reopen the site on swapping.
